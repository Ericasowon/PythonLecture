I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, now. I just want to hold your hand.
My blood, sweat, and tears. My last dance, take it all.
If you want to be happy, just know that I’m always here.
I want to hold you, I want to tell you the truth, but I can’t.
I’m the one I should love in this world. Shining me, I’m the one I should love.
We’re not afraid, we’re not afraid. Not today.
Do your thang, the way you want it. But I’m always gonna keep on dancing.
I’m learning how to love myself, it’s okay.
I need you, I need you, I need you, now. So close, but still far away.
We’ve had enough of this world’s rules. Time to throw it away.
Like an echo in the forest. The day will come back around.
Cause I’m in the stars tonight. So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight.
I need you, I need you, I need you, now. So close, but still far away.
It was destiny, I found you. My heart was ready to bloom.
Your dimple is so perfect. Your smile is like a flower.
Don’t leave me. I’m scared of losing you.
You are the cause of my euphoria.
If only I could be with you for just one day. I would love you forever.
You, you are my universe and I just want to put you first.
I’ll be your moon, shining on you forever. The moonlight’s been waiting for you.
